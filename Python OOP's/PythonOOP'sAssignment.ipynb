    "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "   -> Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects, which represent real-world          entities. These objects contain data (attributes or properties) and behaviors (methods or functions).OOP is based on four main principles:\n",
    "      1-Encapsulation\n",
    "      2-Inheritance\n",
    "      3-Polymorphism\n",
    "      4-Abstraction\n",
    "      Benefits of OOP:\n",
    "      1-Modularity: Code is organized into objects, making it easier to manage and understand.\n",
    "      2-Reusability: Inheritance and modular design facilitate code reuse.\n",
    "      3-Scalability: OOP makes it easier to scale applications by adding new objects or features.\n",
    "      4-Maintainability: Encapsulation ensures that changes in one part of the code do not affect others unnecessarily."

    "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
    "    -> Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that enables objects of different classes to be treated as        objects of a common base class. It is derived from the Greek words \"poly\" (many) and \"morph\" (forms), meaning \"many forms.\"\n",
    "       In OOP, polymorphism is important because it allows a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types or                objects). This capability brings several key benefits to software development such as code reuseability, flexibility and                     extensibility,promotes abstraction and simplifies maintenance."
